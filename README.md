### Netlify Lambda
- Powered by AWS Lambda, but simplified by Netlify. 
- Webpack/Babel based script
- Create functions folder. Create a file with name of function for each function you wish to create.
- Create a netlify.toml configuration file
- Run server-side tasks, test them locally, then deploy them via the lambda folder that is created when running the lambda-serve script
